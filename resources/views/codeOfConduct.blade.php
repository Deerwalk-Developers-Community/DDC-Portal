        <p class='coc_paragraph inter_regular'>




            Deerwalk Developers Community is committed to providing a space for like-minded tech enthusiasts. We believe
            our
            community should be truly open for everyone. We are dedicated to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
            environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, or religion. We do not
            tolerate harassment of any participant in any form.
            This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior as well as the consequences for
            unacceptable behavior. Anyone who violates these rules will be punished or expelled from the community. We
            invite all sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, media, exhibitors, and other participants to help us
            realize a safe and positive conference experience for everyone. Participants are responsible for knowing and
            abiding by these rules.
