                        The Deerwalk Developers Community was formed in the year 2020 with the motive to make a group of
                        enthusiastic learners and help them learn and grow together. During the first year of the
                        Deerwalk Developers Community’s tenure, it had been actively involved in conducting events like
                        Hour of Code, Tech Talks, and a few workshops and Facebook live sessions.

                        With all these productive events, the community had a pretty good start even for its first year.
                        Finally on
                        august of 2021, the tenure for the community ended then through a selective process, DDC
                        selected and finalized the list of its 12 members for the new tenure with Aakash Bhandari as
                        President, Raman Lamichhane as Vice-President and Deena Sitikhu as Treasurer for DDC.

                            Deerwalk Developers Community is a platform at DWIT for students having the same interest to
                            team up together and learn from each other through projects. During the first year of DDC,
                            different events were conducted the community plans to conduct the same events in upcoming
                            future. For the new tenure, the Deerwalk Developers Community plans to build the community
                            to be more like an Open Source Developers Community. DDC will be conducting similar events
                            like last year but this time it will be focused more on developing and maintaining open
                            source projects. DDC also plans to introduce other new programs which are suitable for
                            students to develop their overall skills.
